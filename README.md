# iTrakz
Self-contained bug tracking web application, design to be used in small projects where a full-fledged tracker like Jira is overkill. Allows users to create support tickets regarding bugs in active projects. Users will be able to call back to opened tickets and have exchange messages with the developer. Should have a developer dashboard with visualizations of currently active tickets and the ability to update/modify/open/close tickets.
